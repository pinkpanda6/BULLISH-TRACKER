/**
 * Tests for the documentation generator and its incremental capture logic.
 *
 * Two things are worth testing here and they are both "fails silently"
 * problems:
 *
 * 1. **The capture plan.** Skipping a screen that changed puts a stale picture
 *    in front of the client's staff and nothing complains. Every case below
 *    that asserts a recapture is guarding against that.
 * 2. **The config extractor.** It reads entity configs as text, so a config
 *    written in a slightly different style silently yields fewer fields — which
 *    is exactly how the Active flag went missing from every page in the first
 *    draft. The last group asserts against the real configs, not fixtures, so
 *    the test breaks if the house style moves.
 *
