/**
 * Screenshot fixture seed (ADR-011).
 *
 * Fills a *throwaway* database with presentable demo data so the documentation
 * screenshots show populated screens instead of empty tables. This is not
 * `npm run seed` — that one creates the menu tree and a single admin user, and
 * a screenshot of it is a picture of an empty list.
 *
 *   npm run docs            (runs this, then captures)
 *   node apps/server/seed/fixtures.js
 *
 * The data here is fictional and deliberately dull: an office supplies company
 * with six departments. Nothing in it should read as a real person or company,
 * because it ends up in documentation the client shows their staff.
 *
 * SAFETY: this deletes and rewrites collections, so it refuses to run against
 * any database whose name is not the designated fixture one. See assertFixture-
 * Database below — that guard is the only thing standing between this and
 * somebody's real data.
