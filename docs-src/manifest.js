/**
 * The documentation manifest (ADR-011).
 *
 * One entry per screen the client's end users can reach. This is the source of
 * truth for three things at once: what gets a documentation page, what gets
 * photographed, and what the prose says.
 *
 * ## Why the prose lives here and not in the generated output
 *
 * `docs-src/` is written by people; `apps/admin/src/docs/` is generated and
 * overwritten on every run. Editing a generated page loses the edit at the
 * next `npm run docs`. So anything a human wants to say goes in the `intro`,
 * `when`, `gotchas` and `roles` fields below, and the generator merges it with
 * what it can read out of the entity config.
 *
 * ## What the generator reads for you
 *
 * Do not restate in prose what the entity config already carries. The
 * generator emits the entity's `description`, its `sections` and their
 * descriptions, every field with its label/hint/required flag, and the filter
 * list. Write the things a config cannot know: why the screen exists, what a
 * user is usually trying to do, and what will surprise them.
 *
 * ## Adding, viewing, editing and deleting
 *
 * Every config-driven screen renders the same shared CRUD components, so the
 * steps for the four operations are identical everywhere and the generator
 * writes them for you — do not repeat them per screen.
 *
 * Two flags change what it writes:
 *
 * - `listOnly: true` — the screen lists records and hands off to its own
 *   editor rather than the shared form, so only the viewing section is
 *   emitted, and only the list is photographed.
 * - `shots: [...]` — which views to capture, from `list`, `add`, `view` and
 *   `edit`. The default is all four (just `list` for a `listOnly` screen), so
 *   each operation section is illustrated by the screen its steps describe.
 *   Deleting has no shot of its own: its dialog is a small modal over the list,
 *   which the list image at the top of the page already shows.
 * - `operations: { create, read, update, delete }` — replaces the generated
 *   body of one section for screens that genuinely differ. Use it sparingly;
 *   a screen that needs all four rewritten is probably a custom page.
 *
 * ## Adding a screen
 *
 * A new module adds its screen here in the same commit. A screen missing from
 * this file gets no page and no screenshot, and nothing warns you — see the
 * `client-docs` skill.
 */

/**
 * Shared UI every CRUD screen renders through. A change to any of these moves
 * every config-driven screenshot, so they are fingerprint inputs for all of
 * them. Deliberately broad: over-capturing costs a minute, while a stale
 * screenshot is documentation that lies.
