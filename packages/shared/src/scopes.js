/**
 * Data-scope values stored on UserRoles.dataScope (ADR-002). The server narrows
 * queries with them and the admin UI offers them in the role permissions
 * screen, so the strings have to match character-for-character.
 *
 * - all        — no narrowing; the role sees every row.
 * - department — rows whose department field matches the user's departmentId.
 * - own        — rows whose owner field matches the user's id.
 *
 * A model opts in per dimension via the `scopeable` map it passes to
 * buildScopeFilter(); a model that does not declare the demanded dimension
 * stays unscoped (master data is readable regardless of scope).
